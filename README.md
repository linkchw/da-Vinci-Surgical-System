# Simulation of da Vinci Surgical System

## Overview

This project simulates the functionality of the da Vinci Surgical System, a sophisticated robotic surgical system used in minimally invasive surgeries. The simulation incorporates robotic arm movements, image processing techniques to detect tumors in brain images, and visual feedback mechanisms. The code is implemented in Python using OpenCV and NumPy libraries.

## Features

- **Robotic Arm Simulation:** Simulates the movement of a robotic arm to the tumor's location.
- **Image Processing:** Detects and highlights tumor areas in brain images.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays the original and processed images side by side with annotations.
- **User Interaction:** Allows for simulated control of the robotic arm and camera.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)
- NumPy (`numpy` package)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
